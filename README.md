### Development

#### 1. Setup

Clone or fork this GitHub repository

git clone https://github.com/boxyhq/saas-starter-kit.git
```

#### 2. Go to the project folder

#### 4. Set up your .env file

Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`.

#### 5. Create database (Optional)

To make the process of installing dependencies easier, we offer a `docker-compose.yml` with a Postgres container.

#### 6. Set up database schema

```bash
npx prisma db push

Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database.

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

#### 8. Testing

We are using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to execute E2E tests. Add all tests inside `/tests` folder.

Update `playwright.config.ts` to change playwright configuration.

npm run playwright:update
```
